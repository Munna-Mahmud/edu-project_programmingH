                <p>Our city-centre campus is just a five-minute walk from the train station and served well by buses and dedicated cycle routes, so however you choose to get here, it’ll be safe and convenient.

                    Despite its central location, the college’s riverside location is a peaceful and safe environment to study in, with all the facilities you could need. You can focus on your studies in our well-stocked library or get hair and beauty treatments at our salons for a reduced price. If you’ve missed breakfast or forgotten to bring your lunch, you can grab something at our café or Waterside Restaurant. There’s plenty of outdoor seating areas too to hang out with friends and enjoy the good weather, hopefully!

                    The campus is right next door to the Westgate shopping centre too! You’ll have plenty of opportunities in your free time to head out and grab a snack or drink from one of the many cafés or go shopping at the supermarket or many high-street fashion stores. </p>
